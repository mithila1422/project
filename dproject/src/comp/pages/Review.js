                    <p>One of my favourite websites is Shopping.com. 
                        Itâ€™s great because you can give the good quality products. 
                        Carry on. I hope you will achieve your success.</p>

                        This problem was not before butthere is this problem now.</p>

                    <p>Its a great app for finding almost everything . But there are some issues i faced in 2022 . 
                        1) Prices are becoming higher but the quality of some product is not very appealing. 
                        2) Please make delivery charges little low. Around 60 or 70. 
                        3) Most of the time I got things which are not according to our expectation or poor quality.</p>

                    <p>I've had no serious issues with the platform as I was refunded for an item that categorically wasn't as described. 
                        My grievance is the excessive notifications based on my browsing habits. 
                        I'll let you know if I'm interested, thank you very much. 
                        Even though my notifications are set ONLY for orders, this appears to include promotions based on browsing. 
                        Why not distinguish between the two so 
                        I am not bombarded with unnecessary notifications and only those pertaining to what I actually bought?</p>

                    <p>The only real problem is the frequent ads for sexually explicit products and 
                        inappropriate language used as placeholder text in the search box. 
                        There are things you can buy here you can't get anywhere else, 
                        that said there's also a lot of dodgy looking products. 
                        Most (if not all) products will ship from China which means delivery takes longer but overall good.</p>
